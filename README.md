## Similarites in Dynamical Systems of Human Brain Resting States Inferred from Human Connectome Project (HCP) MEG Data

### Introduction
We describe groups of similar dynamical systems of human brain resting states from MEG data provided by the Human Connectome Project. MEG data was processed with a causality based inference code, which is able to recover connectivities between different MEG sensors across a patient's head. By analyzing the connectivities and comparing the time shift covariances between the original data and simulated data (data simulated from the recovered network connectivities), we are able to show the predictive nature for this network inference. 

### Downloading and Running
In order to run the code, simply download the RestingStateMEG_HCP directory. From there, run the Jupyter Notebook file and the code should be able to run. Within the Jupyter Notebook, there will be explanations for where the parameters are set; feel free to change the code/paramaters to your liking.
